# Introduction #

> Cisco Systems' NetFlow services provide network administrators with
> access to IP flow information from their data networks.  Network
> elements (routers and switches) gather flow data and export it to
> collectors.  The collected data provides fine-grained metering for
> highly flexible and detailed resource usage accounting.

> A flow is defined as a unidirectional sequence of packets with some
> common properties that pass through a network device.  These
> collected flows are exported to an external device, the NetFlow
> collector.  Network flows are highly granular; for example, flow
> records include details such as IP addresses, packet and byte counts,
> timestamps, Type of Service (ToS), application ports, input and
> output interfaces, etc.

> Exported NetFlow data is used for a variety of purposes, including
> enterprise accounting and departmental chargebacks, ISP billing, data
> warehousing, network monitoring, capacity planning, application
> monitoring and profiling, user monitoring and profiling, security
> analysis, and data mining for marketing purposes.
